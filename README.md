# Collaborative Poetry Board

A collaborative poetry board for students to create art together in real-time. To use it, drag words from the rotating list around the screen to the center of the page (to delete a word, just click on it). Your cursor and word choice will be visible to everyone who is online at the same time. Once everyone disconnects, the poetry board will be cleared until people come online againâ€”encouraging moments of spontaneous connection, creativity, and community.
